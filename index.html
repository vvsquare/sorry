        My Love,<br><br>
        I’m writing this with a heart full of regret and love.<br><br>
        I want to say I’m deeply sorry for getting angry. I know I hurt you with my words and my tone, and that’s something I never want to do—because you mean everything to me. You are the light in my life, and seeing even a shadow fall over us breaks my heart.<br><br>
        I didn’t mean to upset you. I let emotions take over when I should’ve held your hand tighter and spoken with love. You deserve patience, care, and understanding—not my frustration.<br><br>
        I miss your smile, your voice, and the warmth you bring into my world. If I could go back and hold you instead of raising my voice, I would do it a thousand times.<br><br>
        Please forgive me, my love. Let me make things right, slowly and gently—like the way I fell for you.<br><br>
        With all the love in my heart,<br>
        Yours forever.
